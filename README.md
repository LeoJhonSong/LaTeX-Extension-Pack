# LeTaX Extension Pack

This is a collection of extensions I use when writing LeTaX files. I would be
glad if you are interested in this pack and just give a try! :thumbsup:

This pack includes:

- [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)
- [latex-formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nickfode.latex-formatter)

If you find a extension really useful when developing python code and want to
improve this extension, feel free to [raise a issue](https://github.com/LeoJhonSong/MarkDown-Extension-Pack/issues).
But please notice that **issues using the extensions included in this pack**
will not be accepted in this extension pack's repository:sweat_smile:.

**Enjoy!**
